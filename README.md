# Cafe-Website
## This is my most favourite website because it is my first  website which I made during my 2nd year of  college  and at that time i was very happy that I have made a website on my own. :)
### For making this website i only used floats and positions .
### And the name of this website was kept very thoughtfully, I wanted a unique name for the website, so I asked my friend, then she suggested me this name and I also find it very unique and good too.
### And yes it is fully responsive .
